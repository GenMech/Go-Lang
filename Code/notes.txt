- Closures can also be recursive, but this requires the closure to be declared with a typed var explicitly before it’s defined.
- Closure, is a form from Anonymous Function that refers to variables specified outside of the function itself. It is equivalent to accessing global variables that existed before the function's declaration. It works similarly to a regular function and perform all the things perform by any function.
- Go’s select lets you wait on multiple channel operations. Combining goroutines and channels with select is a powerful feature of Go.
- Each channel will receive a value after some amount of time, to simulate e.g. blocking RPC operations executing in concurrent goroutines.
